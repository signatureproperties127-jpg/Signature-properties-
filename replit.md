# Signature Realty OS — Project Architecture

## What this project is

A **full-stack real-estate brokerage CRM** built in Node.js with a vanilla HTML/CSS/JS frontend. It manages the complete lead-to-deal lifecycle: leads → transactions → requirements → matching → site visits → negotiation → token → deal → commission → closing.

All data is persisted in a single JSON file (`data/sig-realty-db.json`). No external database or framework is used.

---

## Tech stack

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Runtime | Node.js 20 (CommonJS) |
| HTTP server | Built-in `node:http` |
| Database | JSON file (`data/sig-realty-db.json`) via `JsonRepository` |
| Frontend | Vanilla HTML + CSS + JavaScript (no framework) |
| Testing | Node.js built-in test runner (`node:test`) + Playwright (e2e) |
| Port | `4173` (or `process.env.PORT`) |

              │               └── NEGOTIATION → TOKEN → DEAL
              │               └── MATCHING ← INVENTORY/PROPERTY

```

### Invariants (must never be broken)

- **One Client = One Lead.** Client and Lead are the same record; there is no separate Client entity.
- **Transaction belongs to exactly one Lead.**
- **Requirement belongs to exactly one Transaction AND one Lead.** `Requirement.LeadID` must always equal `Transaction.LeadID` — enforced at creation time.
- **Requirement must never embed Inventory/Property data.** Requirements describe what the buyer/tenant wants; Inventory describes what exists. Matching is a separate entity that links them.
- **FormVersion is immutable** after a Requirement is created (captures the form schema at submission time).

---

## V2 ID format

All V2 entities use zero-padded sequential IDs:

| Entity | Format | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Lead | `L` + 6 digits | `L000001` |
| Transaction | `T` + 6 digits | `T000001` |
| Requirement | `R` + 6 digits | `R000001` |

V1 legacy IDs keep the old format (`LEAD-0001`, `TXN-001`, `REQ-001`). Both coexist in the same collections, differentiated by the `_v2: true` marker.

## Service architecture

### Data layer — `JsonRepository`

Single class, single file. Every DB operation goes through it. Reads the JSON file, mutates the in-memory object, writes back atomically.

Key collections in `db`:
```
Leads, Transactions, Requirements, RequirementHistory
Activities, FollowUps, Timeline
Inventory, Matches, Shortlists, SiteVisits
Negotiations, NegotiationHistory, Tokens, Deals, Payments
Commissions, CommissionHistory, Closings
Documents, Media
Owners, Builders, Projects, Brokers, BrokerNetwork
Users, Roles, Permissions, Settings, MasterData, PipelineConfig
Notifications, FormRegistry, AuditLog
_V2Counters, _V2MigrationMap   ← V2-only
```

### V2 service layer

```
V2LeadService
  createLead(payload, actor, opts)    → duplicate check (EXACT/POSSIBLE/NO_MATCH) → write
  updateLead(leadId, payload, actor)  → status/lifecycle workflow transitions
  addTag / removeTag                  → TagConfig-validated
  recalculateScore                    → ScoringConfig-driven ClientScore

V2TransactionService
  createTransaction(leadId, payload)  → validates Lead exists, EntityConfig statuses
  updateTransaction(txnId, payload)   → WorkflowConfig status transitions
  getTransaction / listTransactionsByLead

V2RequirementService
  createRequirement(txnId, payload)   → parent-chain validation (LeadID == Txn.LeadID)
                                      → form validation (required fields, option membership,
                                         positive-number constraints from V2FormRegistry)
                                      → FormVersion frozen at creation
                                      → RequirementScore computed
  updateRequirement(reqId, payload)   → FormVersion immutable, status transitions enforced
  getFormConfig(txnType, cat, subCat) → resolves V2FormRegistry key
  listGlobalRequirements(filters)     → enriched with clientName
```

### V2 API layer — `V2Router`

Dispatched at the TOP of `server.js:handleApi()` before all legacy handlers. Returns `null` to fall through to legacy.

**Feature flag:** `LEAD_V2_ENABLED=true` environment variable.

| Routes | Active when |
|---|---|
| `POST /api/leads/check-duplicate` | Always |
| `GET\|POST /api/leads/:leadId/transactions` | Always |
| `GET\|PATCH /api/transactions/:id` | Always |
| `GET\|POST /api/transactions/:id/requirements` | Always |
| `POST /api/leads/:id/score` | Always |
| `POST\|DELETE /api/leads/:id/tags[/:tag]` | Always |
| `GET /api/clients/:leadId/workspace` | Always |
| `GET /api/v2/config` | Always |
| `GET /api/v2/form-config` | Always |
| `GET /api/v2/form-registry` | Always |
| `GET /api/v2/requirements/global` | Always |
| `GET\|POST /api/leads` | LEAD_V2_ENABLED=true only |
| `GET\|PATCH /api/leads/:id` | LEAD_V2_ENABLED=true only |
| `GET /api/requirements` | LEAD_V2_ENABLED=true only |
| `GET\|PATCH /api/requirements/:id` | LEAD_V2_ENABLED=true only |

---

## V2 configuration — `v2Config.js`

### Entity statuses and lifecycle

```
Lead ClientStatus:    New → Verified → Active → Inactive → Blacklisted
Lead Lifecycle:       Prospect → Client → Past Client → Inactive → Blacklisted
Transaction Status:   Open → Active → Closed | Cancelled
Requirement Status:   Draft → Active → Paused → Closed | Lost | Archived
Pipeline Stage:       New → Matching → Shortlisted → Site Visit → Negotiation → Token → Deal
```

### Form Registry (V2FormRegistry)

40+ form entries keyed by `TransactionType|Category|SubCategory`:

| Transaction type | Categories |
|---|---|
| Purchase / Sale | Residential (Flat, Villa, Row House, Bungalow, Penthouse, Studio) |
| Rent / Rent Out | Residential (Flat, Villa, Row House, Bungalow) |
| Lease / Lease Out | Residential (Flat) |
| Purchase / Rent / Sale | Commercial (Office, Shop, Showroom, Warehouse) |
| Rent Out / Lease / Lease Out | Commercial (Office, Shop) |
| Purchase / Sale | Land (Residential Plot, Commercial Plot, Agricultural Land) |
| Purchase / Rent / Lease / Lease Out | Industrial (Factory, Warehouse) |

Each form entry has `commonFields` (BudgetMin, BudgetMax, Location, Urgency, etc.) and `categoryFields` (BHK, Area, BusinessType, Zoning, ZoneType, etc.) with `required`, `fieldType`, `options`, and `validation` metadata.

### Scoring

- **ClientScore** (max 100): tags quality, lifecycle, activity recency, requirements count, budget clarity
- **RequirementScore** (max 100): budget presence, location presence, category completeness, urgency level

## UI pages

| URL | File | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | `index.html` | Legacy dashboard |
| `/login.html` | `login.html` | Authentication |
| `/clients` | `clients.html` | V2 Client List — stats bar, filter chips, sortable table, Add Client modal with real-time duplicate check |
| `/client-workspace?id=L000001` | `client-workspace.html` | V2 Client Workspace — 6 tabs (Overview, Transactions, Requirements, Activities, Follow-ups, Timeline), edit/add modals with dynamic form fields |
| `/requirements-view` | `requirements-view.html` | V2 Global Requirements — multi-filter toolbar, urgency/stage/score display |

---

## Migration

**Script:** `node scripts/migrateV2.js [--dry-run] [--apply] [--rollback] [--report]`

- Default is `--dry-run` — zero DB writes (in-memory ID allocator only)
- `--apply` accumulates all changes in memory, writes once atomically
- `--rollback` reverts using `db._V2MigrationMap`
- V1 records are never deleted; V2 copies are added alongside them with `_migratedFromV1: true`

---

## Key decisions & rules for future work

1. **Never bypass V2Router for V2 entities.** All V2 mutations go through the service layer, not direct `repo.write()`.
2. **Requirement.LeadID == Transaction.LeadID is non-negotiable.** Enforce it in every code path that creates or links a Requirement.
3. **Form validation uses V2FormRegistry.** Any new Requirement creation path must call `V2RequirementService._validateFormFields()`.
4. **Body caching is critical.** `server.js` caches the parsed request body in `req._parsedBody`. Any new middleware that reads the request body must check `req._parsedBody` first; never re-read a consumed stream.
5. **Same DB collections for V1 and V2.** Never create separate V2 collections. Use `_v2: true` marker.
6. **No auto-migration.** `migrateV2.js` must be run manually with `--apply`.
7. **`LEAD_V2_ENABLED=false` by default.** Shared routes fall through to legacy handlers; only new (non-overlapping) V2 routes are always active.

## Running the project

```bash
node server.js                          # Start server on port 4173
node --test test/leadV2.test.js         # Run V2 unit tests (65 tests)
node scripts/migrateV2.js              # Dry-run migration report
node scripts/migrateV2.js --apply      # Apply V1 → V2 migration
node scripts/migrateV2.js --rollback   # Rollback last migration
```

---

## User preferences

- All 20 V2 phases must complete without stopping for confirmation.
- No redesign of Inventory, Matching, Deal, Commission, Auth/RBAC, or Deployment.
- Legacy V1 APIs must always remain live regardless of feature flag state.
